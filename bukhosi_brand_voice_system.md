## CAPTION EXAMPLES BY CATEGORY

### Product Feature:
```
"Our 2021 Chenin Blanc comes from bush vines planted in 1976 & 1983 — heritage you can taste. 🍷

Aged 12 months, this wine carries notes of ripe quince, yellow apple, and white peach. Lukas Wiegman, Netherlands' Best Sommelier, called it 'uniquely complex.'

Every bottle tells the story of our terroir, our craft, and our royal legacy.

#BukhosiRoyalWines #CheninBlanc #OldVines #SouthAfricanWine #HeritageInEveryPour"
```

### Behind the Scenes:
```
"Harvest season at Bukhosi means early mornings, careful hands, and generations of wisdom. 🌄🍇

My mother taught me that great wine begins in the vineyard — with respect for the land and patience with the vines.

This is why we hand-harvest and sort every grape. Excellence takes time.

### Celebration/Lifestyle:
